The Firebase Realtime Database sometimes throws a `FirebaseError: The client is offline.` error even when the client has a stable internet connection. This can be caused by several factors, including incorrect network configuration on the device or issues with the Firebase server. Additionally, this error is not always accompanied by helpful debugging information, making it difficult to trace the root cause.
