# Firebase Realtime Database Offline Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive bug in Firebase's Realtime Database: receiving an 'offline' error even when the internet connection is stable. The issue stems from the lack of detailed error messages making debugging problematic.  The `bug.js` file showcases the error scenario, while `bugSolution.js` explores potential solutions and workarounds.

## Solutions

* **Improved Error Handling:** Enhance your error handling to include more verbose logging of network conditions and Firebase error details.
* **Network Monitoring:** Implement proactive network monitoring to detect intermittent connectivity issues.
* **Connection Retry Logic:** Add exponential backoff retry mechanisms to reattempt database operations when offline errors occur.
* **Check Firebase Server Status:** Before troubleshooting, check the Firebase server status to rule out server-side outages.
